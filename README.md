**WARNING**

If you have used the app to any capacity before 7/8/23, you may encounter an error where your balance shows as NaN, and your transactions show up blank when using the latest version of the application. 
This is due to a new value being added to a certain object that wasn't previously stored in local storage. 
To fix this issue, please **clear local storage if you are on PC**, or **clear site data if you are on mobile** 
This will solve this issue and return the site to normal functionality 

A simulated banking app designed for the Education market to teach students how to bank, manage their finances, and use banking software.

The first upload of files (3/23/2023) is merely a markup test. Used to test the website's responsiveness and allow actual users to see it in real-time. Upon the site loading, you will see an alert describing what I've said here. 

As of 07/08/2023, the website now has the following features:
1: Loans (You can now request a loan to be added to your account)
2: Donations (You can now donate funds to the bank itself)
3: Transfers (You can now transfer funds between your accounts)
4: Bill and Payments (You can now set up your bills and paychecks to occur at intervals of seconds meant to represent days (i.e. 7 seconds representing a week, or 7 days) 

**THIS WEBSITE IS A DEMO VERSION ONLY AND USES LOCAL STORAGE WITH JSON FOR DATA STORAGE.** 

The production website will include backend and serverside programming that will include the following features: 

1: Backend donation system (This is a system where the donations users make are split among users, rewarding those who donate more) 
2: Live bill and paycheck dates (Instead of having seconds represent bill and check intervals, there will be a system for actual time intervals for these to occur) 
3: Sending funds to other users (This system will be put in place so that users can send funds to other users at any time and those funds be handled immediately. 
4: A loan payback system (When you request a loan, this system will be put in place, requiring users to pay back the loan after a certain amount of time, and penalize users for not keeping up with loans. 

DISCLAIMER: As stated before, this website is an educational banking *simulator* and not a live bank. No real-life funds are being transferred, nor can this app be used to purchase real-life items or services. 

This website includes PDFs for official Documentation in the code files. There you will find a Tutorial with an in-depth guide on using the app, and a developer handbook with detailed code explanations for each feature.
